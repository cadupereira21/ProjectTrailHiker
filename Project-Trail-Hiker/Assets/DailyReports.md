## DAY 1 - 18/08/2021

Today I worked hard to figure out how to implement the movement system. Couldn't make it work today, but will make it tomorrow;

## DAY 2 - 19/08/2021

Today I worked on all the movement features of our game. They are all too raw, but functional, so our character is able to jump, move back and forward and crouch;

## DAY 3 - 20/08/2021

I worked to improve the movement mechanics, so now we can't jump and crouch as we please, you can control your jump height, and the speed is divided in 5 categories, from super slow to super fast. I also added the fall feature, even tough we don't have animation. I want to implement my virtual camera next;

## DAY 4 - 23/08/2021

Today I was able to implement some changes on my Collision detection, a tip given to me by a mentor. It fixed my level generator bug, that was breaking the movement system. With the generator fixed, I implemented some improvements in it, to get close on how we want it to create the levels

## Day 5 - 25/08/2021

I improved the Level Generator + Prototyped something about our scores and added some UI, so I can generate a build tomorrow and send to some people for testing purposes.

## Day 6

I improved the Level Generator + Added a new Initial Scene and improved the movement system

## Day 7 - 01/09
Today I implemented the Quick Time Event system. It still need balance and it's pretty static, but i'm sure I can make it really dynamic :)

## Day 8 - 02/09
Today I tried all the assets from my artists, added the walking animation on my character and improved the quick time event! Now you can fall on it ahuahuahua. I'm also trying to implement the system where you fall every time your balance reaches 0 :)

## Day 9 - 07/09
Today I fully implemented the system where you fall whenever your balance reaches 0. I was also able to implement the obstacle QTE, now we only need to polish it!

## Day 10 - 08/09
Today I improved the QTE system with a responsive UI and improved the movement manager code

## Day 11 - 11/09
Today I improved the slope QTE Physics, as well as fixed a bug in the walking animation while on a slope. I also added the company and game logo to the initial scene

## Day 12 - 13/09
Today I implemented our footsteps sfx and ambient sound. It still need improvement, but I will wait 'till ww have more environment art, so I can implement all music, audio and sfx organically with the environment and game art
