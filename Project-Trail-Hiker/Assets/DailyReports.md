## DAY 1 - 18/08/2021

Today I worked hard to figure out how to implement the movement system. Couldn't make it work today, but will make it tomorrow;

## DAY 2 - 19/08/2021

Today I worked on all the movement features of our game. They are all too raw, but functional, so our character is able to jump, move back and forward and crouch;

## DAY 3 - 20/08/2021

I worked to improve the movement mechanincs, so now we can't jump and crouch as we please, you can control your jump height, and the speed is divided in 5 categories, from super slow to super fast. I also added the fall feature, even tough we don't have animation. I want to implement my virtual camera next;

## DAY 4 - 23/08/2021

Today I was able to implement some changes on my Collision detection, a tip given to me by a mentor. It fixed my level generator bug, that was breaking the movement system. With the generator fixed, I implemented some improvements in it, to get close on how we want it to create the levels

## Day 5 - 25/08/2021

I improved the Level Generator + Prototyped something about our scores and added some UI, so I can generate a build tomorrow and send to some people for testing purposes.

## Day 6

I improved the Level Generator + Added a new Initial Scene and improved the movement system

## Day 7 - 01/09
Today I implemented the Quick Time Event system. It still need balance and it's pretty static, but i'm sure I can make it real√ßy dynamic :)
